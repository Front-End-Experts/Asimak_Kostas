        <p>This Essential Grocery List is a life saver on the busy weeks. The first step in cooking is gathering all of your ingredients, but you do not
            <br>want to run out to the grocery store every single time you prepare a new recipe. Having a well-stocked pantry will make life in the kitchen
            <br>so much simpler, because you will have most of what you need every time you cook. It’s so helpful to have a basic grocery list to help you
            <hr>
            <br>remember which foods to buy at the store. This food shopping list is my go-to! It’s better to stock up on things like grains, seasonings and
            <br>spices, baking essentials, oils, condiments, canned and frozen foods, etc. so you can just grab them when you need them. These things have
            <br>a long shelf life, so keep them in your kitchen for convenience. However, you do have to go the supermarket sometimes, and there’s a way to
            <br>make that trip easy and hassle-free: Keep a grocery list! If you go in blindly, you’ll leave with things you don’t need, and nothing that actually
            <br>helps you prepare a good meal. So what do you put on that list though? Well, I’ve got you covered! I created an easy grocery list filled with
            <br>all of the essentials. Plus there’s a free printable version that you can take with you to the grocery store. It has everything you need to
            <br>stock your pantry, your freezer, and your refrigerator.
