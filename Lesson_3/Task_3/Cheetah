        <h3>Cheetah</h3>
        <p>The cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) is a large cat with a tawny to creamy white or pale buff fur that
            <br>is marked with evenly spaced, solid black spots. Its head is small and rounded, with a short
            <br>snout and black tear-like facial streaks. It reaches 67–94 cm (26–37 in) at the shoulder,
            <br>and the head-and-body length is between 1.1 and 1.5 m (3 ft 7 in and 4 ft 11 in). Adults
            <br>weigh between 21 and 72 kg (46 and 159 lb). It is the fastest land animal, capable of running
            <br>at 80 to 98 km/h (50 to 61 mph); it has evolved specialized adaptations for speed, including
            <br>a light build, long thin legs and a long tail. It was first described in the late 18th century.
            <br>Four subspecies are recognised today that are native to Africa and central Iran. An African
            <br>subspecies was introduced to India in 2022. It is now distributed mainly in small, fragmented
            <br>populations in northwestern, eastern and southern Africa and central Iran. It lives in a
            <br>variety of habitats such as savannahs in the Serengeti, arid mountain ranges in the Sahara
            <br>and hilly desert terrain. Cheetahs live in three main social groups: females and their cubs,
            <br>male "coalitions", and solitary males. While females lead a nomadic life searching for prey
            <br>in large home ranges, males are more sedentary and instead establish much smaller territories
            <br>in areas with plentiful prey and access to females. The cheetah is active during the day, with
            <br>peaks during dawn and dusk. It feeds on small- to medium-sized prey, mostly weighing under 40
            <br>kg (88 lb), and prefers medium-sized ungulates such as impala, springbok and Thomson's gazelles.
            <br>The cheetah typically stalks its prey within 60–100 m (200–330 ft) before charging towards it,
            <br>trips it during the chase and bites its throat to suffocate it to death. It breeds throughout
            <br>the year. After a gestation of nearly three months, females give birth to a litter of three or
            <br>four cubs. Cheetah cubs are highly vulnerable to predation by other large carnivores. They are
            <br>weaned at around four months and are independent by around 20 months of age. The cheetah is
            <br>threatened by habitat loss, conflict with humans, poaching and high susceptibility to diseases.
            <br>In 2016, the global cheetah population was estimated at 7,100 individuals in the wild; it is
            <br>listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List. It has been widely depicted in art, literature,
            <br>advertising, and animation. It was tamed in ancient Egypt and trained for hunting ungulates in
            <br>the Arabian Peninsula and India. It has been kept in zoos since the early 19th century.
